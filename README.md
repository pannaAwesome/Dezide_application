# Dezide Tasks

The Dezide Troubleshooter considers causes, probability, time and cost when making its
suggestion for the best corrective action that is suggested in the Troubleshooter. The cost of
something is considered a monetary value that is a function of time , money and optionally
other customer specific factors like risk and inconvenience.

Each customer system is configured with a mandatory global value for the relationship
between time and money (estimated cost of an hour). Each troubleshooting model may
specify another hourly cost, that should be used instead of the global factor.

There are two tasks in this assignment. The first task asks you to build a basic reusable cost
converter component (to be used in a larger system), and the second task asks you to
expand upon your solution for task one by extending your solution to handle the custom
costs, too.

The calculations are trivial, so it is important that you demonstrate the ability to design a
solid software architecture that shows your thoughts around good software development
craftsmanship.

Your code should reflect your ability to build modular, high-quality software that is designed
to be maintainable in the long run.

The solution must be implemented in Java. We expect that you spend no more than a
couple of days on building your solution. You can send the code to us in whatever way you
find easier (zip, github, etc.).

We are looking forward to hearing about your design choices and the reasoning behind
them!

## Solution
The solution for the assignments can be found in the folders *Task_1* and *Task_2*, where a description of the given tasks are explaned in the README's in each folder, and a .jar file can be used for running the programs.
